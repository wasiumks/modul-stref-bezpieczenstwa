### Guidelines for JAVA

#### SPRING_BOOT

- Use Spring Boot for simplified configuration and rapid development with sensible defaults
- Prefer constructor-based dependency injection over `@Autowired`
- Avoid hardcoding values that may change externally, use configuration parameters instead
- For complex logic, use Spring profiles and configuration parameters to control which beans are injected instead of hardcoded conditionals
- If a well-known library simplifies the solution, suggest using it instead of generating a custom implementation
- Use DTOs as immutable `record` types
- Use Bean Validation annotations (e.g., `@Size`, `@Email`, etc.) instead of manual validation logic
- Use `@Valid` on request parameters annotated with `@RequestBody`
- Use custom exceptions for business-related scenarios
- Centralize exception handling with `@ControllerAdvice` and return a consistent error DTO: `{{error_dto}}`
- REST controllers should handle only routing and I/O mapping, not business logic
- Use SLF4J for logging instead of `System.out.println`
- Prefer using lambdas and streams over imperative loops and conditionals where appropriate
- Use `Optional` to avoid `NullPointerException`

#### SPRING_DATA_JPA

- Define repositories as interfaces extending `JpaRepository` or `CrudRepository`
- Never expose JPA entities in API responses – always map them to DTOs
- Use `@Transactional` at the service layer for state-changing methods, and keep transactions as short as possible
- Use `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` for read-only operations
- Use `@EntityGraph` or fetch joins to avoid the N+1 select problem
- Use `@Query` for complex queries
- Use projections (DTOs) in multi-join queries with `@Query`
- Use Specifications for dynamic filtering
- Use pagination when working with large datasets
- Use `@Version` for optimistic locking in concurrent updates
- Avoid `CascadeType.REMOVE` on large entity relationships
