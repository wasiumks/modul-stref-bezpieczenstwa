## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for ARCHITECTURE

#### DDD

- Define bounded contexts to separate different parts of the domain with clear boundaries
- Implement ubiquitous language within each context to align code with business terminology
- Create rich domain models with behavior, not just data structures, for {{core_domain_entities}}
- Use value objects for concepts with no identity but defined by their attributes
- Implement domain events to communicate between bounded contexts
- Use aggregates to enforce consistency boundaries and transactional integrity
